                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The political argument of abortion has recently been a very popular subject. The conundrum has only two sides, Pro-Life and Pro-Choice. Pro-Choicers believe that women should have the choice to have an abortion. They claim it's used for medical reasons, amongst others. Today, I'll be giving you my thoughts and opinions on the current situation, along with a plausible solution to this argument.</p>

                        <h2>The Use of Sex</h2>
                        <p>One of the most used claims for Pro-Choicers is that women need abortions for their medical health. In fact, only .36% of abortions were for the health of the mother. Alan Guttmacher of Planned Parenthood states that, "Today it is possible for almost any patient to be brought through pregnancy alive, unless she suffers from a fatal disease such as cancer or leukemia, and if so, abortion would be unlikely to prolong, much less save the life." So what are abortions actually used for? Well, according to <a href="https://clinicquotes.com/99-31-of-abortions-not-done-for-health-reasons/">clinicquotes.com</a>, 99.31% of abortions are for social cases, or pure convenience. Meaning that abortions are primarily used for the sake of birth control or a way to just get rid of the child.</p>
                        <p>Sex is widely used by people for pleasure and short-term happiness. It's become so normalized that the world revolves around it. The porn industry is bigger than ever. Songs and movies have to have a sexual reference or else they wont do well. Really, sex should only be used for it's purpose, reproduction. If people learned to express their love in a responsible and pure way, then there wouldn't be need for birth control. I don't want to live in a world where people sell their bodies for profit and people are just okay with that. It's like they praise it.</p>
